## Graph Summarizer

</div>


### 1) Abstract
Data is everywhere. The world is driven by it. We have information being thrown at us from all directions, presenting a challenge in making sense of it. So we have different ways to understand it all. Graphs being one that come to our aid, providing us with visual representation. But if the data can be complex then so can the graphs generated from it. And making sense of it all can be another difficult task. Having a tool to summarize it all in one place can make our lives so much easier. Our objective is to develop one such Graph Summarizer tool that gives you clarity in this sea of information. It breaks down difficult data into understandable short summaries. By including different parameters, we hope to surpass conventional summarizer tools. We seek to help users extract valuable information efficiently, ultimately enhancing decision-making and understanding of data.

Keywordsâ€”Graph Summarizer, short summaries

### 2) About the Project
The Graph Summarizer project is a command line project focusing on on simplifying complex graphs into short summaries while maintaining crucial information. Its goal is to help in easier visualization and analysis of graph data, increasing understanding and help people make smarter decisions. We hope to addresses the challenge of dealing with large volumes of complex data.
The project takes the image of the graph and then reads it, extracts text and other information and then applies logic. Further it generates a summary in pdf format with all the extracted information.

### 3) Working
Firstly you go to the  `main` folder. 
Then in the terminal you can write the command below to summarize bargraph
```terminal
python abc.py summarize bargraph.png bargraph
```
or write 
```terminal
python abc.py summarize linegraph.png linegraph
```
if you want to summarize linegraph.

This will generate a pdf `summary_report.pdf` containing the entire summary.

### 4) Future Scope
This project has a lot of scope and can be further worked upon. Currently its incorporating bargraph and linegraph. In future we aim to include other 2D graph in the coming month like - Scatter Plot, Line Graph, Area Graph etc. 
Further 3D and 4D graphs are can also be worked upon and summarized using our tool in future.

### 5) Motivation

"The world is one big data problem."

The motivation behind this was the dire need to make sense of things. Currently there is next to nothing in the market about summarization of graphs and in doing so we can help a lot of people. Even big companies require such tools at their disposal to make their work faster and efficient. From a simple college kid working on a dataset to a MNC everyone in this world will and can make use of our tool.
